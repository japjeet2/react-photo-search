## Dev
To setup the script on your own machine, clone the repo and then install all the dependencies by using this command on the console:
`npm install`
This will install all the required package, it will take a few minutes so relax and have a cup of coffee while waiting :). After it's done, execute this command:
`npm start`
It will then run the app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

## Build
The build system uses Webpack. It will generate the build folder containing all the optimized and bundled script to be used in production. Builds the app for production to the build folder. Everything would be minified and the filenames include the hashes. It will then ready to be deployed. To build it, use this command
`npm run build`
